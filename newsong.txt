All embrace me
It's my time to rule at last
Fifteen years have I been waiting
To sit upon my throne

No allegiance
I will swear no oath
Crowned by god not by the church
As my power is divine

My time has come

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
